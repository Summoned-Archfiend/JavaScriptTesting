# Create React App

Create React App is an `npm package` which makes it much quicker and simpler for us to set up our `React` applications. You can perform these steps manually, or even use `React` as a CDN, but Create React App comes with a package of configured items including our pre-configured items such as: Webpack, Babel, RTL, and Jest. `npx` is the tool used to download create-react-app templates, this downloads the latest templates each time, so if you are wanting to use a specific version remember to provide a version argument (for instance if you are spinning up docker containers to run your app in).
